# Specs

This folder contains lightweight, spec-driven docs for features/changes.

## How to use

1. Copy the template: `specs/000-template.md`
2. Rename it to the next number, e.g. `specs/001-auth.md`
3. Fill it in before implementation.
4. Keep it short; focus on behavior and acceptance criteria.

## Naming convention

- `NNN-short-title.md` (e.g. `001-health-endpoints.md`)
- Prefer one spec per change/feature.
